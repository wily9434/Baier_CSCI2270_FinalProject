This project is created to help college students in the Boulder area determine the relative cost of living in the various
towns around Boulder. The idea is that all the student has to enter is the amount of roommates they will have as well as
the rent cost and what town the unit is in, and the program will automatically add on average costs for water, waste disposal,
electricity, internet, as well as gas to CU Boulder. If the city is not found in the list of nearby communities then 
the program will ask the user to pick another option.

This program was designed in a virtual machine running Ubuntu. In order to run the program you must open "main.cpp" as well as
"Towns.h" and "Towns.cpp" in your preferred IDE. Run the program from the IDE and select whichever menu option you so choose.

This program only utilizes cmath, iostream, sstream, and fstream libraries, so you should not need to download any additional
libraries assuming you already have an IDE to work with C++.

This program was created by Patrick Baier, thank you for checking it out!

#Bugs
-Would enter an infinite loop if user inputes a string at the main menue instead of an integer.
